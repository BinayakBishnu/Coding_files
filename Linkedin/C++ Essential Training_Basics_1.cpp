    //qualifiers
    //1. CV: 
    //const - immutable/read-only
    //volatile - maybe changed by another process (used for threaded code)
    //mutable - can be changed
    //2. Storage duration: (lifetime of variable)
    //static - these variable live for whole program not just the block
    //even if declared in class, stored globally
    //by default variable declared outside all blocks are static 
    //register - stored in process register, faster and easy to access
    //extern - defined separately and linked to code by linker step
    
    //without static ->
    //declare a function which initialises a variable, increments by 1 then returns it
    //run multiple times
    //each time value same 
    //with static ->
    //all same exceot declare variable as static integer
    //now each time value different
    //ignores initialisation after first one

    //now if same thing done in class function
    //all objects of class share same static variable
    //static member is =0
    //if 1st obj declared, value of static member increased
    //second obj declared, value of static member increased
    //third obj declared, value of static member printed
    //value shown =2 not 0
    
    //very helpful to count number of objects of a class declared
    //since value of static member not reset
    return 0;
